# Quantum — Unified AI Intelligence Suite

> **Where Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge, and Creativity Converge.**  
> *A production-grade AI workspace built with MERN, GenAI, and advanced data visualization.*

---

## Overview

**Quantum** is a **full-scale AI Intelligence Suite**, not just a chatbot.

It is designed as a **single unified workspace** where users can:

- Converse intelligently with AI  
- **Chat with their own documents** via a full **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline  
- Analyze documents and content deeply  
- Visualize knowledge and insights in **2D & 3D**  
- Generate executive summaries and strategies  
- Create AI-generated images using diffusion models  
- Securely manage data with **enterprise-grade authentication**

This project demonstrates **real-world system design, AI orchestration, security engineering, and polished UX** — exactly what recruiters look for beyond basic demos.

## Why Quantum Stands Out

- End-to-end **MERN Stack** architecture  
- Full **RAG pipeline** — embeddings, vector search, and grounded chat over your own files  
- Multiple **AI systems orchestrated together**  
- Secure **OAuth + JWT hybrid authentication**  
- Advanced **3D knowledge graphs & analytics**  
- Integrated **AI Image Generation (NeuraPix)**  
- Product-level **UI/UX & workflow design**  
- **Production-ready deployment** mindset

## Core Modules

---

## Authentication & Security System (Enterprise-Grade)

Quantum is built with a **security-first architecture**, clearly demonstrated by its authentication flows.

### Features
- Email & Password authentication  
- OAuth 2.0 login with **Google** and **GitHub**  
- Secure **Sign Up / Sign In / Forgot Password** flows  
- Encrypted password storage using **bcrypt**  
- Password reset via **secure email token (SMTP)**  

### Security Design
- **JWT Access Tokens** (15 minutes)  
- **JWT Refresh Tokens** (15 days)  
- Tokens stored in **HttpOnly cookies** (XSS-safe)  
- **Helmet.js** for secure headers (CSP, XSS, CSRF)

*Screenshots show clean, professional authentication UI — exactly what production apps require.*

## Quantum Chat — Context-Aware Conversational AI

> An intelligent assistant designed for **deep reasoning, learning, and productivity**.

### Capabilities
- Context-retaining multi-turn conversations  
- Coding help, explanations, reasoning, and creativity  
- Chat history persisted in **MongoDB**  
- File-aware intelligence (chat with documents)  

### Unique Feature
- **One-click conversion of conversations into structured mind maps** using **Mermaid.js**, enabling visual understanding of complex topics.

---

## RAG Engine — Chat With Your Documents

> Ask questions and get answers **grounded in your own files**, powered by a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.

### Ingestion Pipeline
- Upload **PDF / DOCX / TXT / MD / CSV / JSON** files  
- Documents are parsed into structured `Document` objects with metadata (`utils/dataLoader.js`)  
- **Recursive text chunking** (1000 chars, 200 overlap) preserves context across chunk boundaries (`utils/chunker.js`)  
- Each chunk is embedded with **Gemini Embedding (3072-dim)** and stored in a `chunks` collection  

### Retrieval
- Queries are embedded and matched against your indexed chunks (`utils/retriever.js`)  
- **MongoDB Atlas `$vectorSearch`** as the primary path (auto-created index)  
- **Local cosine-similarity fallback** — works on any MongoDB, no Atlas required  
- Similarity threshold (`RAG_MIN_SCORE`) filters out irrelevant context  

### Chat Integration
- Retrieval runs **automatically** when you have indexed documents — just ask  
- Scope answers to **specific documents** via the Knowledge Base picker (`documentIds`)  
- **Temporary attachments** (`saveToKB: false`) are never indexed and are deleted after the message  
- Tunable via env vars: `RAG_TOP_K`, `RAG_MIN_SCORE`, `MAX_ATTACH_CHARS`

## Insight Engine — Deep Content & Knowledge Intelligence

> Transform raw text into **actionable intelligence**.

### Features
- Readability analysis (Flesch–Kincaid)  
- Tone & sentiment analysis  
- Estimated reading time  
- Entity extraction (organizations, concepts, topics)  
- **Interactive 3D Knowledge Graphs**  
- **Content DNA radar charts**

### Visualization Stack
- **Plotly.js** — 3D entity relationships  
- **Chart.js** — radar & analytics charts  

### Use Cases
- Market & business analysis  
- SEO & content evaluation  
- Academic research  
- Strategic writing  

---

## Quantum Studio — Document Intelligence Workspace

> A powerful learning and research environment.

### Capabilities
- Upload multiple documents (**PDF / TXT / DOCX**)  
- Compare documents side-by-side  
- Generate structured summaries  
- Auto-create **flashcards** for revision  
- Ideal for exams, research papers, and knowledge synthesis  

---

## NeuraPix — AI Image Generation Studio (Integrated)

**NeuraPix**, your previous AI Image Generator project, is now **fully integrated into Quantum** as a creative intelligence module.

### Features
- Text-to-image generation  
- Powered by **Stable Diffusion via Hugging Face**  
- Prompt-driven creative workflows  
- High-quality AI-generated visuals  

### Why This Matters
This demonstrates:
- Modular system design  
- Reusability of prior projects  
- Real-world integration of **GenAI pipelines**

---

## Knowledge Base — Persistent AI Memory

> Your personal AI knowledge repository.

### Features
- Stores uploaded files & insights  
- Files are **automatically indexed for RAG** on upload (chunked + embedded)  
- Select specific documents to **scope chat retrieval** to just those sources  
- Global search across workspace  
- Acts as long-term AI memory  
- Enables reuse of past intelligence
